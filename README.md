# scheduler
Scheduler to balance work, sleep, and job search time (for personal use).
I work in an Amazon warehouse. But I also want a better job. So I want to dedicate 40 hours of time to job searching, while also working as much as possible, all while maintaining sufficient sleep. The good thing about Amazon is that it has flexible hours, and you can take Voluntary Time Off (VTO). So I can take VTO and have the scheduler will balance out my work, sleep, and job search time.
